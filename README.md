# Padoru
A small Processing project based on the Padoru and DVD memes

This Processing sketch was a 1 afternoon project and "challenge" to myself. I had nothing to do so I decided to make this.

This sketch opens a window that moves arround on your screen and bounces on the it's sides, much like the DVD meme.
It displays a gif of Saber from the Padoru meme and sings her christmas song.
If you try to move your mouse on top of the window it just randomly "teleports" away to another location of your screen.

I did try to make it not closeable, and eventualy did. But this version does not contain that feature. Since It would be annoying to get rid of Padoru.

Compile and run using Processing 3.5.3
